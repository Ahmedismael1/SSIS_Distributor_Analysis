# SSIS_Distributor_Analysis

## Summary:
- This project showcases a data transformation and analysis pipeline utilizing Microsoft SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS), SQL Server, and Tableau. It takes data from three distributor files, performs various transformations using SSIS packages, and loads the transformed data into a new table in SQL Server. Finally, Tableau is used to visualize and analyze the transformed data, extracting valuable insights.

## Objectives:
1) Data Transformation:
- Combine data from three Distributor files into a single, unified source.
- Perform data cleansing and enrichment to ensure accuracy and completeness.
- Apply transformations to format data according to desired business rules.

2) Data Loading:
- Create a new SQL Server table with appropriate schema to store transformed data.
- Efficiently load cleansed and transformed data into the new table.
3) Data Analysis:
- Use Tableau to analyze key trends and patterns within the data.
- Extract actionable insights and identify opportunities for improvement.

## Technologies:
- Microsoft SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS): for data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) process.
- Microsoft SQL Server: for data storage and relational database management.
- Tableau: for data visualization and exploration.

## Key Features:

- Automated data transformation pipeline ensures consistency and efficiency.
- Clean and organized data facilitates accurate analysis and reduces data errors.
- Powerful visualizations in Tableau provide clear insights into the data.
- Flexible and scalable architecture allows for future expansion and integration with other systems.

## Benefits:

1) Improved data quality and accessibility.
2) Enhanced decision-making through data-driven insights.
3) Increased efficiency through automated data processing.
4) Improved business intelligence and reporting capabilities.

## Target Audience:
 This project is relevant to data analysts, business intelligence professionals, and anyone interested in learning about data transformation and analysis using SSIS, SQL Server, and Tableau.
